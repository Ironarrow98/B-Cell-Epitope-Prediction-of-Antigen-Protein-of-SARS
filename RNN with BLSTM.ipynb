As a result, various methods for vaccine development have been tested over the past two years. \n","\n","Since vaccines serve to increase production of antigen-specific antibodies, a crucial step in vaccine development is to identify the region(s) on an antigen protein where antibodies bind – otherwise known as epitope regions. Upon recognition of such epitope regions, B-cells induce antigen-specific immune responses in vivo and produce significant quantities of antigen-specific antibodies, which inhibit the function of antigen proteins by binding to their epitope regions. \n","\n","Therefore, the automated prediction of epitope regions is extremely beneficial for developing vaccines to induce antigen-specific antibody production. It is currently one of the key research topics in vaccine development that will be widely useful for future medical data analysis. Conventional methods for epitope prediction include analysing the three-dimensional structures of antibody-antigen complexes by X-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. However, these methods incur significant time, labor and financial costs. \n","On the other hand, current machine learning methods for epitope prediction focus only on the target sequence of the peptide region without considering the whole protein sequence and features. \n","\n","In this part of our project, we will combine a recurrent neural network model (RNN) with Bidirectional LSTM to predict B-cell/SARS epitopes to consider the characteristics of a whole antigen protein in addition to the target sequence.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WcaDbtUZI8E9"},"source":["# Data \n","\n","We used an existing dataset, which combines information extracted from both the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), a free epitope database and prediction resource, as well as Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) – a comprehensive collection of protein sequences and their annotations. It consists of two data files – one for B-cell, and one for SARS.\n","\n","The B-Cell and SARS dataset consist of an activity label which indicates – based on the number of antigen-binding sites (0 or 1) – whether a peptide exhibits antibody-inducing activity, as well as other non-class attributes: \n","* Parent protein ID\n","* Parent protein sequence\n","* Start/End positions of the peptide\n","* Peptide sequence\n","* 4 Peptide features: \n","  * chou_fasman, used to calculate the possibility of β turn, which helps to analyze the relative frequency of amino acid\n","  * emini, which is used to get relative surface accessibility that represents the surface area of a biomolecule that is enabled access to a solvent\n","  * Antigenicity, which refers to interaction between epitopes and antibodies or specific T cell receptors for antigens\n","  * Hydrophobicity refers to insolubility in water \n","* 4 Protein features: \n","  * the isoelectric point, which represents the pH when the molecule carries no net electrical charge\n","  * Aromaticity allows the electrons in the molecule to be delocalized around the ring, increasing the molecule's stability\n","  * Hydrophobicity\n","  * Stability, defined as the quality of maintaining a constant character in the presence of forces that resistance to change\n","  \n","The total number of records is 14387 for the B-cell (training) dataset and 520 for the SARS (test) dataset.

However, the original RNN encounters gradient vanishing and gradient explosion problems. Therefore, we use LSTM, which is normally augmented by recurrent gates, which include input gates, output gates, and forget gates to prevent back-propagating errors from gradient vanishing and gradient explosion. \n","\n","Furthermore, to better calculate the relationship, the bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) is used in the prediction model, which combines forward LSTM and backward LSTM to preserve the upstream and downstream information of the peptide sequence by combining the two hidden states. In this model, the RNN module analyses the training input using 64 + 20 LSTM units in both directions within two layers, over 100 epochs.

In B-cell, all the score of 1 are 0, we think the reason may cause by imbalance of dependent data. The 1 in B-cell is 1288 and 0 is 3460, almost three times more than 1. So, in the future we can use oversampling to solve the class imbalance. Back to SARS, the prediction on 0 and 1 are good. The macro and weighted average of precision is much better than B-cell, increased over 20% to 40%. \n","\n","Compared to Machine Learning part, the deep learning is not as good as expected. Though the recall and f1 score of 1 in machine learning is also low, RNN is only 0.01 and 0.03. we think the reason is still the imbalance of dataset.\n","\n","Most of time, RNN is used for time series problem or sequential data, when the current step has relation with the previous steps. In this step, RNN is used for target analysis especially for sequence. \n"]}]}
